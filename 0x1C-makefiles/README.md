# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

## Introduction

The Makefile is a build automation tool that allows programmers to automate the building and compiling of complex projects. It's often used in combination with C projects, where the build process can quickly become tedious and error-prone.

In this repository, we will explore the basics of Makefiles in C programming, how to create them, and how to use them effectively to manage project builds and dependencies.

## What is a Makefile?

A Makefile is a build automation tool that uses a set of rules to build and compile code. It takes a list of dependencies and commands, and it will execute those commands only if a dependency has been updated since the last build.

Makefiles can be used to automate the build process for any programming language or platform, but they are most commonly associated with C programming.

## How to Create a Makefile

A Makefile is a simple text file that can be created with any text editor. The basic syntax of a Makefile is as follows:
